📊 3-Statement Financial Model & Forecast Analysis

📄 Project Overview

This project consists of a fully integrated 3-Statement Financial Model designed to analyze historical performance (2014–2016) and project future financial health (2017–2021). The model links the Income Statement (P&L), Balance Sheet (BS), and supporting schedules (Debt and Fixed Assets) to create a dynamic tool for valuation and strategic decision-making. It includes scenario-based forecasting to assess various business outcomes.

🏗️ Project Structure

The workbook is organized into logical sections to ensure transparency and ease of audit:

Data Foundation:

Original Source: Raw historical data containing dates, financial categories, and amounts.

Workings: Data cleaning and mapping layer where raw data is categorized into financial headers (e.g., mapping "Cogs - Supermarkets" to "Cost of goods sold").

Historical Financials:

BS 2014 / 2015 / 2016: Granular historical Balance Sheets used as the baseline for the model.

Integrated Model & Forecasts:

P&L (Profit & Loss): Historicals and 5-year forecasts. Features scenario toggles (e.g., "Best Case") and margin analysis.

BS (Balance Sheet): Integrated forecast including working capital ratios (DSO, DPO, DIO) and cash flow integration.

Supporting Schedules:

Fixed Assets Roll Forward: Tracks PP&E, Depreciation & Amortization (D&A), and Capital Expenditures (Capex).

Financial Liabilities: A dedicated debt schedule calculating principal repayments and interest expenses over a 10-year period.

🔍 Key Findings

Historical Growth: Net Income saw a significant spike in 2016, reaching $303.2 million, up from $36.7 million in 2015.

Forecast Horizon: The model projects steady revenue growth through 2021, with Net Income reaching $402.1 million in the "Best Case" scenario.

Efficiency Metrics: The model tracks operational efficiency with stabilized inventory days (DIO) and receivable days (DSO) forecasted through 2021.

Debt Profile: The company maintains a structured repayment plan for its $615.8 million initial debt, with interest rates modeled at 9%.

🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used

Microsoft Excel: Advanced formula auditing and data organization.

Financial Modeling: Integration of the 3 core financial statements.

Data Mapping: Transforming unstructured raw data into standardized financial reporting formats.

Scenario Analysis: Implementation of "Best Case" and other scenario toggles to stress-test the forecast.

Schedules: Building automated Fixed Asset and Debt Amortization tables.

🚀 How to Use

Review Inputs: Start with the Workings tab to understand how raw data is mapped to the statements.

Toggle Scenarios: Navigate to the P&L tab (Cell C3) to switch between different forecast scenarios to see real-time updates across all statements.

Audit Schedules: Check the Fixed Assets and Financial Liabilities tabs to see how D&A and Interest expenses flow into the P&L and Balance Sheet.

Analyze Ratios: Use the bottom of the BS tab to monitor liquidity and efficiency ratios over the forecast period.
